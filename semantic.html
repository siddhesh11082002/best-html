<!-- Semantic HTML refers to the practice of using HTML markup in a way that conveys the meaning and structure of the content on a webpage, making it more accessible to both browsers and developers. 

Semantic HTML uses HTML elements that have a clear and meaningful purpose, such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, <footer>, <h1> to <h6> for headings, <p> for paragraphs, <ul> and <ol> for lists, and so on. These elements provide a logical structure to the content, making it easier for search engines, screen readers, and other web technologies to understand the content and present it in a meaningful way to users.

Semantic HTML Tags:
1. <header>: Represents the header of a section or a webpage, typically containing a logo, a site title, navigation links, or other introductory content.

2. <nav>: Represents a navigation menu, typically used to contain links that allow users to navigate through different sections or pages of a website.

3. <footer>: Represents the footer of a section or a webpage, typically containing copyright information, contact details, or other supplementary content.

4. <main>: Represents the main content area of a webpage, excluding headers, footers, and sidebars. It is typically used to wrap the primary content of a webpage.

5. <section>: Represents a section of content that is thematically related, such as a chapter or a group of related articles. It can be used to divide content into meaningful sections.

6. <article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content that could be distributed and reused independently, such as a news article, blog post, or forum post.
