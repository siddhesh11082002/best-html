HTML :
HTML is a standard markup language used to create web pages and web applications. It uses markup tags to structure content and is interpreted by web browsers to render visual web pages. It is an essential technology for building websites and web applications on the internet.

Basic Terminologies :
Opening tag: This is the beginning part of an HTML tag and is enclosed in angle brackets (< >). It indicates the start of an element and defines its type or name. For example: <p> for a paragraph element.

Element name: This is the name that identifies the type of element, such as <p> for a paragraph, <h1> for a heading 1, <a> for an anchor (link), etc.

Attributes: These are optional properties that provide additional information about an element. Attributes are placed inside the opening tag and are separated by spaces. They have a name and a value, separated by an equals sign (=) and enclosed in double or single quotes. For example: <a href="https://example.com">.

Content: This is the actual text or data that is contained within the element. It appears between the opening and closing tags of an element. For example: <p>Hello, world!</p>.

Closing tag: This is the ending part of an HTML tag and is also enclosed in angle brackets, but with a forward slash (/) before the element name. It indicates the end of an element. For example: </p> to close a paragraph element.

<!DOCTYPE html>: This is the doctype declaration, which specifies the version of HTML being used in the document. In modern web development, the HTML5 doctype <!DOCTYPE html> is used.
<html>: This is the root element of an HTML document, and it contains all the other elements on the web page. It has two child elements: <head> and <body>.
<head>: This element contains meta-information about the web page, such as the title, character encoding, and linked stylesheets or scripts. However, it does not render any content on the web page itself.
<title>: This element is used to define the title of the web page, which is displayed on the browser's title bar or tab.
<body>: This element contains the main content of the web page, such as text, images, links, and other HTML elements. This is where the visible content of the web page is displayed in the browser.
