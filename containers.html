<!-- Types of Containers :
1. Block-level Containers : These are container elements that create block-level elements on a web page. Block-level elements take up the full width of their parent element and create a new line after the element, creating a vertical stack of elements. Examples of block-level containers include <div>, <section>, <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, and <aside>. These elements are often used for creating layout structures and grouping content.

2. Inline Containers : These are container elements that create inline-level elements on a web page. Inline-level elements do not create a new line after the element, and they only take up the space needed by the content within them. Examples of inline containers include <span>, <em>, <strong>, <a>, <label>, and <button>. These elements are often used for grouping and styling inline content, such as text or inline-level elements.

3. Generic Containers : They generally refer to generic HTML elements that can be used as containers to group and organize content, without any specific semantic meaning or styling associated with them. These generic containers are typically used for layout purposes, creating structure, and applying styles as needed.Examples of generic containers include <div> and <span>. -->
