<!-- 
Types Of Meta Tags :
1. <meta charset="UTF-8"> : 

This tag is used to declare the character encoding of an HTML document.The charset attribute specifies the character set used in the document, which is typically UTF-8, a widely used character encoding that can represent almost all characters in the Unicode character set.

2. <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> : 

The <meta> tag with the http-equiv attribute and X-UA-Compatible value is used to specify the version of Internet Explorer (IE) that the web page should be rendered in.The value of IE=edge indicates that the web page should be rendered in the highest version of IE available in the browser, regardless of the version that is being used. This helps ensure that the page is rendered properly and functions as expected in all versions of IE.

3. <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> : 

This tag is used in HTML to set the viewport of the page.The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page, and it varies depending on the device being used. By setting the viewport with this tag, we can make sure that the web page looks good and is properly scaled on all devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.The width=device-width attribute sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device, which means the web page will automatically adjust to the size of the device's screen. The initial-scale=1.0 attribute sets the initial zoom level of the web page to 100%, which means the web page will be displayed at its original size when the user first visits the page.

4. <title>Meta Tags</title>

This tag is used to define the title of the HTML document. It is typically placed within the <head> section of the HTML file and is displayed in the title bar of the web browser when the page is opened. The text inside the <title> tag is also used by search engines as the main title for the page in search results. 

5. <meta name = "author" content="GFG">

This meta tag is used to provide information about the author of the webpage. The "name" attribute is used to specify the type of metadata and the "content" attribute is used to define the value of that metadata.

6. <meta name = "description" content="This is a description">

This tag with name="description" is used to provide a brief description of the content of the webpage. It is often used by search engines to display a short summary of the page in search results. The content attribute is where the description text is provided.

7. <meta name = "keywords" content= "Movies,top 50 movies,gfg">

This tag is used to provide the search engines with a list of keywords or phrases relevant to the content of the webpage. These keywords or phrases help search engines to index the webpage properly and improve its visibility in search results.
