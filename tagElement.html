<!-- 
Types :
1. Heading Tag :
In HTML, a heading tag is used to define the headings or titles of a webpage. There are six levels of heading tags : h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. The h1 tag is used for the main heading or title of the webpage, and the subsequent tags (h2, h3, etc.) are used for subheadings and other levels of headings.

The syntax for heading tags from h1 to h6 is as follows:

<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
The h1 tag represents the most important or highest-level heading on the page, while h6 represents the least important or lowest-level heading.

2. Paragraph Tag : 
The paragraph tag <p> in HTML is used to define a paragraph of text. It is a block-level element, which means it creates a rectangular block of content that takes up the full width of its container. 

The syntax for the paragraph tag is as follows:

<p> Your text here </p>
3. Span Tag :
The <span> tag is used as a container for small pieces of content that are inline with the surrounding text, such as a word or phrase. It is an inline element and does not create a new line. The purpose of the <span> tag is to apply styling or scripting to specific content without affecting the structure of the document. It can also be used to group and apply the same styling to multiple inline elements. The syntax for the <span> tag is:

<span> Content goes here </span>
 

Difference between <p> tag and <span> tag :

 

<span> Tag	<p> Tag
Defines a small inline section of content	Defines a paragraph
Does not add line breaks before or after the element	Adds a line break before and after the element
Used to group inline elements and apply styles	Used to structure larger blocks of text
Example: <span style="color: blue;">Hello World!</span>	Example: <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
4. List Tag :
There are three types of lists that can be used to display information in a structured way. These are:

(I) Ordered List (<ol>): An ordered list is a list of items where each item is numbered. It is created using the <ol> tag.

Syntax:

<ol>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ol>
(II) Unordered List (<ul>): An unordered list is a list of items where each item is bulleted. It is created using the <ul> tag.

Syntax:

<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
(III) Definition List (<dl>): A definition list is a list of terms and their corresponding definitions. It is created using the <dl> tag.

Syntax:

<dl>
  <dt>Term 1</dt>
  <dd>Definition 1</dd>
  <dt>Term 2</dt>
  <dd>Definition 2</dd>
  <dt>Term 3</dt>
  <dd>Definition 3</dd>
</dl>
Note: In the definition list, <dt> tag is used for the term and <dd> tag is used for its definition.

The type attribute in the list tag (<ul> and <ol>) is used to define the type of list marker that should be used for each list item. There are several values that can be used for the type attribute:

For ordered lists (<ol>), the type attribute can be used to specify the numbering style of the list. The default value is "1", which is for decimal numbering. Other possible values are "A" for uppercase alphabetical numbering, "a" for lowercase alphabetical numbering, "I" for uppercase Roman numerals, and "i" for lowercase Roman numerals.
For unordered lists (<ul>), the type attribute can be used to specify the type of bullet or marker that should be used for each list item. The default value is "disc", which is a solid bullet. Other possible values are "circle" for a hollow circle, "square" for a solid square, and "none" for no bullet or marker.

<i> Italicized text </i>
8. Underline Tag :
The <u> tag is used to underline text. Here is the syntax for the <u> tag:

<u> Underlined text </u>
9. Strikethrough Tag :

Syntax:

<s>Text to be striked through</s>

The syntax for the <small> tag is as follows:

<small> Smaller Text </small>
