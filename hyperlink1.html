 The hyperlink tag, commonly known as the <a> tag in HTML, is used to create hyperlinks or links to other web pages, documents, or resources on the internet. The <a> tag is one of the most commonly used tags in HTML for creating clickable links.

The basic syntax of the <a> tag is as follows:

<a href="URL">Link Text</a>
Where:

href: This is the attribute that specifies the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the target document or resource that the link points to. It can be an absolute URL (e.g., "https://example.com") or a relative URL (e.g., "page.html" or "../documents/document.pdf").
Link Text: This is the text that appears as the clickable link on the web page. It is the text that users click on to navigate to the target document or resource.

Explanation :
The first line, <!DOCTYPE html>, is the document type declaration. It tells the browser that the document is an HTML5 document.
The second line specifies that the document is in the English language, using the lang attribute in the <html> tag.
Inside the <head> section, there are several <meta> tags. These tags provide metadata about the document. The first <meta> tag specifies the character encoding used in the document (UTF-8). The second <meta> tag specifies that the document should be rendered in the latest version of Internet Explorer. The third <meta> tag sets the viewport width to the device's width and scales the content accordingly.
The <title> tag sets the title of the page, which appears in the browser's title bar.
Inside the <body> section, there is a single <h1> heading tag that displays the text "About page".
Finally, there is an <a> tag that creates a hyperlink to the GeeksforGeeks website. The href attribute specifies the URL of the website, and the text "Click Me" is displayed as the link text. When the user clicks on this link, they will be taken to the GeeksforGeeks website.
Types Of Hyperlink Tags :
1. Absolute Hyperlinks : Absolute hyperlinks use the complete URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the target document or resource. They include the protocol (e.g., "http://" or "https://"), domain name (e.g., "example.com"), and the specific path or file name (e.g., "/page.html" or "/images/image.jpg"). Absolute hyperlinks point to a specific web address on the internet.

2. Relative Hyperlinks : Relative hyperlinks use a relative path to the target document or resource, which is relative to the current web page's location. Relative hyperlinks do not include the protocol or domain name, but instead specify the path or file name of the target document or resource relative to the current web page's location. Relative hyperlinks are commonly used when linking to documents or resources within the same website or domain.
